# Unofficial University of Southampton BSc Mathematics Notes, written by a current 1st-year student.

These notes are **not official** and are based on my understanding of lectures, problem sheets, and independent reading.  

This repo contains my working notes for first-year mathematics modules at the Southampton Topics currently include:

- [[Calculus I]]
- [[Linear Algebra I]]
- [[Number Theory I]]
- [[Intro to Probability and Stats]]

The aim is to build a clear, student-friendly guide that complements the official course materials, rather than replaces them.

These notes may contain errors or simplifications.  
Always cross-check with official lecture notes, textbooks, or lecturers’ guidance before relying on them.

If you spot a mistake or think something could be explained better, feel free to open an **issue** or submit a **pull request**!
